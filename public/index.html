        <p class="text">stopping the spread of coronavirus. They are looking to collect plasma at licensed plasma donation centers across the US from healthy individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Known as convalescent plasma, the plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients contains critical antibodies that can be used to make an experimental treatment.</p>
        <p class="text">The sooner scientists receive so-called convalescent plasma donations, the sooner the Alliance may be able to start manufacturing an investigational plasma-derived therapy and begin clinical trials. These trials will determine if the investigational therapy could help high-risk COVID-19 patients recover and whether it could protect high-risk individuals from the disease.</p>
        <p class="text">If your doctor has confirmed that you have fully recovered from COVID-19 and are no longer contagious, we encourage you to contact your nearest plasma donation center. You might be eligible to donate plasma and help others recover from COVID-19.</p>
        <p class="text">Providing your information does not obligate you to donate, and it does not guarantee that you will be able to participate in the donor program. All candidates must provide valid identification and are required to undergo a medical screening to ensure eligibility. Medical staff will be available to explain the donation process and answer any questions you may have before you agree to donate. The Alliance takes your privacy very seriously, and your information will be managed in accordance with all local, state, and federal regulations.</p>
        <p class="text">The new coronavirus is still spreading, and COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide. We need survivors like you to help us develop potential treatments for those still at risk.</p>
        <p class="text">Thank you for joining us in the fight against COVID-19. Finding a treatment starts with you.</p>

        <p class="text">If you have recovered from COVID-19 recently, your plasma may have the power to help others through a potential treatment for the new coronavirus.</p>
        <p class="text">By donating your plasma, a part of your blood that contains proteins and antibodies, you could play a key role in helping scientists develop an investigational plasma-derived therapy for treating high-risk COVID-19 patients that will be tested in clinical trials this summer. The results of these trials will determine whether the new therapy has the potential to treat high-risk COVID-19 patients and prevent pulmonary disease in people at increased risk of infection from the virus, including healthcare workers.</p>
        <p class="text">The fight against COVID-19 starts with you. You’re a survivor. Now be a hero. Learn more here about how you can be a part of this historic effort to treat the new coronavirus and stop the spread of the pandemic.</p>
