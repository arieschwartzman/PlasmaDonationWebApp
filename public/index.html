        <p class="text">stopping the spread of coronavirus. They are looking to collect plasma at licensed plasma
            donation centers across the US from healthy individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Known as
            convalescent plasma, the plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients contains critical antibodies that can be used
            to make an experimental treatment.</p>
        <p class="text">The sooner scientists receive so-called convalescent plasma donations, the sooner the Alliance
            may be able to start manufacturing an investigational plasma-derived therapy and begin clinical trials.
            These trials will determine if the investigational therapy could help high-risk COVID-19 patients recover
            and whether it could protect high-risk individuals from the disease.</p>
        <p class="text">If your doctor has confirmed that you have fully recovered from COVID-19 and are no longer
            contagious, we encourage you to contact your nearest plasma donation center. You might be eligible to donate
            plasma and help others recover from COVID-19.</p>
        <p class="text">Providing your information does not obligate you to donate, and it does not guarantee that you
            will be able to participate in the donor program. All candidates must provide valid identification and are
            required to undergo a medical screening to ensure eligibility. Medical staff will be available to explain
            the donation process and answer any questions you may have before you agree to donate. The Alliance takes
            your privacy very seriously, and your information will be managed in accordance with all local, state, and
            federal regulations.</p>
        <p class="text">The new coronavirus is still spreading, and COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide. We
            need survivors like you to help us develop potential treatments for those still at risk.</p>
        <p class="text">Thank you for joining us in the fight against COVID-19. Finding a treatment starts with you.</p>

        <p class="text">If you have recovered from COVID-19 recently, your plasma may have the power to help others
            through a potential treatment for the new coronavirus.</p>
        <p class="text">By donating your plasma, a part of your blood that contains proteins and antibodies, you could
            play a key role in helping scientists develop an investigational plasma-derived therapy for treating
            high-risk COVID-19 patients that will be tested in clinical trials this summer. The results of these trials
            will determine whether the new therapy has the potential to treat high-risk COVID-19 patients and prevent
            pulmonary disease in people at increased risk of infection from the virus, including healthcare workers.</p>

        <p class="key-steps">Here are the key steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Registration</span>
                <p>Prospective donors show identification, enter their contact info, and take a photo and fingerprint
                    scan so they can be entered into the donation center’s electronic system. A medical historian also
                    checks the prospective donor’s name in a national registry to make sure they are eligible to donate.
                    All identification and medical information is confidential.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Screening</span>
                <p>All donors must pass a pre-donation screening at every appointment. First-time donors are interviewed
                    about their medical history. Typical questions include medications, allergies, medical conditions,
                    and surgeries. First-time donors will also undergo a routine health exam. The goal of this screening
                    is to make sure that the donation is safe for both the donor and the recipient of the final
                    product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Donation Area</span>
                <p>Once donation eligibility has been confirmed, donors are led to the donation area. Here, they rest on
                    recliners while connected to an automated machine, and are carefully monitored by staff throughout
                    the donation process. Donors are welcome to relax, read, or use free Wi-Fi to watch their favorite
                    shows.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Plasma Donation</span>
                <p>The safe and sterile process for donating plasma is called plasmapheresis (“plaz-muh-fuh-REE-sis”).
                    It is similar to donating blood, except that plasma is separated and collected while red and white
                    blood cells are returned to the body.</p>

                            <p class="text">Plasma is the pale yellow liquid portion of your blood, and it can be easily
                                replaced by your body. It consists mainly of water and proteins, which help your body
                                control bleeding and infection.</p>

                            <p class="title">How is Plasma Used?</p>
                            <p class="text">Plasma is processed into a wide variety of life-saving treatments that help
                                thousands of people every day. These plasma-derived therapies are used to treat serious
                                and rare diseases, including primary immunodeficiency and hemophilia. It is important to
                                remember that human plasma cannot be made in a lab or by artificial methods. It only
                                comes from healthy adults. Plasma donors help save lives and treat serious and rare
                                diseases.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This process is automatically repeated until a target amount of plasma has been collected, which
                    typically takes less than an hour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Compensation</span>
                <p>Donors receive compensation for their time in the form of a debit card. Donors who qualify for the
                    COVID-19 program will receive $200 for each visit, up to a total of $400 for two donations completed
                    within 14 days.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Where can I donate?</p>
            <p class="text">There are hundreds of licensed collection centers across the US. Find your nearest
                center by clicking on this link.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">I have young children. Can I bring them with me?</p>
            <p class="text">During the COVID-19 pandemic, to help prevent the spread of the virus, it is advised
                that donors visit plasma centers without accompanying guests or children. This is for the health
                and safety of you and your loved ones as well as other donors and plasma collection staff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Is donating plasma safe?</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Donating plasma is generally a safe and proven process.</b></p>
            <p class="text">The tubing and all other equipment that comes in contact with your blood is
                discarded and replaced with new, sterile materials each time a donation is made. Your blood
                never enters the collection machine. We also use sterile techniques for drawing blood.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Does donating plasma hurt?</p>
            <p class="text">If you can tolerate donating blood, or giving blood during medical
                appointments, you should be able to tolerate plasma donation. Our highly trained professionals
                take great care to minimize any possible discomfort.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Will I feel faint or weak afterwards?</p>
            <p class="text">You shouldn’t. Unlike donating blood, which sometimes does make people feel
                that way because they lose red blood cells, the plasma donation process returns both red and
                white blood cells back to your body. Drinking plenty of water the day before and the day of your
                donation will help you feel fine after your donation. That said, if you have a history of
                feeling faint at the sight of blood, please let us know.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">How many times will I need to donate?</p>
            <p class="text">Individuals who are donating to help the Alliance initiative must donate
                twice, in two separate appointments at least one day apart. As much as we appreciate your first
                donation, it can only be used once you donate a second time. That’s because your second donation
                allows us to repeat testing for specific infectious diseases. This ensures that the plasma is
                safe to use.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Will my donated plasma go directly to a COVID-19 patient?</p>
            <p class="text">No. Plasma collected from individual donors is pooled, processed, and
                concentrated into a liquid that contains antibodies (part of the immune system). This
                plasma-derived therapy must then be tested in clinical trials to determine if it is safe and
                effective before it could be approved as a treatment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Why aren’t you giving donated plasma directly to COVID-19 patients through
                transfusions?</p>
            <p class="text">Plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 – known as
                “convalescent plasma” – contains antibodies that can help fight the virus. This plasma can be
                used in two ways. One way is transfusing it directly to people who have active COVID-19. The
                other is using the plasma to make a potential treatment called a polyclonal hyperimmune globulin
                (H-IG), which concentrates the antibodies into a medicine.</p>
            <p class="text">Both uses are important, and both have the potential to treat COVID-19. We welcome
                all initiatives to address the pandemic, including vaccines and other treatments. The work of
                The CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is focusing on developing an H-IG, which has properties that make
                it a very promising candidate for a potential global treatment for COVID-19.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">What are the benefits of H-IG?</p>
            <p class="text">Because H-IG has a higher concentration of antibodies, it can be delivered in lower
                volumes, and therefore would likely take less time to administer to patients than plasma itself.
                H-IG also has a longer shelf life, which makes it easier to ship to patients around the world.
                Both of these attributes also make H-IG much easier for hospitals to store and administer to
                patients.</p>
            <p class="text">The manufacturing process used to produce plasma-based therapies makes it
                possible to set standards for antibody levels. This process, which includes numerous steps of
                virus inactivation and removal, significantly reduces the risk of transmitting any kind of virus
                (not just coronavirus) from donors to patients.</p>
            <p class="text">Plasma-derived therapies, like H-IG, have already been shown to be effective in
                treating severe viral respiratory infections. The work of the Alliance is determining whether
                they may also be a potential option for treating high-risk COVID-19 patients and preventing
                pulmonary disease in people at increased risk of infection from the virus, including healthcare
                workers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Is this part of the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project?</p>
            <p class="text">No. Though you might have heard about that or similar efforts in recent weeks, or
                even know someone who is participating in them, the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is a separate
                initiative led by the world’s leading plasma experts. A key difference is that we are not giving
                plasma itself to COVID-19 patients, but instead using the plasma we collect to help develop a
                potential therapy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Do I need to tell my doctor or insurance company that I’m donating?</p>
            <p class="text">Your doctor will need to provide written documentation that you have recovered from
                COVID-19 and are no longer contagious. You shouldn’t need to inform your insurance provider, as
                you will not be charged in any way for your donation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Do I need to change my diet?</p>
            <p class="text">In general, no. However, you should be well-nourished. Please eat a light but
                healthy meal three hours before your donation. This means a meal that is high in protein (such
                as eggs, fish, or nuts), rich in iron (such as tuna, lean red meat, nuts, or beans), and low in
                fat (fatty or fried foods can interfere with laboratory testing). Since plasma is 90% water, you
                should also be well-hydrated, so drink plenty of water, juice, or other fluids the day before
                your donation. Please do not drink any alcohol the night before or the day of your donation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question">Can I donate more than twice?</p>
            <p class="text">You certainly may donate more than twice — so long as you’re eligible at each
                donation. We encourage you to consider becoming a regular plasma donor to help save lives!
                Plasma is used in a variety of therapies, including to help treat serious and rare diseases.</p>
