            <h1>Where can I donate?</h1>
            <p>There are hundreds of licensed collection centers across the US. Find your nearest
                center by clicking on this link.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>I have young children. Can I bring them with me?</h1>
            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, to help prevent the spread of the virus, it is advised
                that donors visit plasma centers without accompanying guests or children. This is for the health
                and safety of you and your loved ones as well as other donors and plasma collection staff.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Is donating plasma safe?</h1>
            <p><strong>Donating plasma is generally a safe and proven process.</strong></p>
            <p>The tubing and all other equipment that comes in contact with your blood is
                discarded and replaced with new, sterile materials each time a donation is made. Your blood
                never enters the collection machine. We also use sterile techniques for drawing blood.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Does donating plasma hurt?</h1>
            <p>If you can tolerate donating blood, or giving blood during medical
                appointments, you should be able to tolerate plasma donation. Our highly trained professionals
                take great care to minimize any possible discomfort.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Will I feel faint or weak afterwards?</h1>
            <p>You shouldn’t. Unlike donating blood, which sometimes does make people feel
                that way because they lose red blood cells, the plasma donation process returns both red and
                white blood cells back to your body. Drinking plenty of water the day before and the day of your
                donation will help you feel fine after your donation. That said, if you have a history of
                feeling faint at the sight of blood, please let us know.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>How many times will I need to donate?</h1>
            <p>Individuals who are donating to help the Alliance initiative must donate
                twice, in two separate appointments at least one day apart. As much as we appreciate your first
                donation, it can only be used once you donate a second time. That’s because your second donation
                allows us to repeat testing for specific infectious diseases. This ensures that the plasma is
                safe to use.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Will my donated plasma go directly to a COVID-19 patient?</h1>
            <p>No. Plasma collected from individual donors is pooled, processed, and
                concentrated into a liquid that contains antibodies (part of the immune system). This
                plasma-derived therapy must then be tested in clinical trials to determine if it is safe and
                effective before it could be approved as a treatment.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Why aren’t you giving donated plasma directly to COVID-19 patients through
                transfusions?</h1>
            <p>Plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 – known as
                “convalescent plasma” – contains antibodies that can help fight the virus. This plasma can be
                used in two ways. One way is transfusing it directly to people who have active COVID-19. The
                other is using the plasma to make a potential treatment called a polyclonal hyperimmune globulin
                (H-IG), which concentrates the antibodies into a medicine.</p>
            <p>Both uses are important, and both have the potential to treat COVID-19. We welcome
                all initiatives to address the pandemic, including vaccines and other treatments. The work of
                The CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is focusing on developing an H-IG, which has properties that make
                it a very promising candidate for a potential global treatment for COVID-19.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>What are the benefits of H-IG?</h1>
            <p>Because H-IG has a higher concentration of antibodies, it can be delivered in lower
                volumes, and therefore would likely take less time to administer to patients than plasma itself.
                H-IG also has a longer shelf life, which makes it easier to ship to patients around the world.
                Both of these attributes also make H-IG much easier for hospitals to store and administer to
                patients.</p>
            <p>The manufacturing process used to produce plasma-based therapies makes it
                possible to set standards for antibody levels. This process, which includes numerous steps of
                virus inactivation and removal, significantly reduces the risk of transmitting any kind of virus
                (not just coronavirus) from donors to patients.</p>
            <p>Plasma-derived therapies, like H-IG, have already been shown to be effective in
                treating severe viral respiratory infections. The work of the Alliance is determining whether
                they may also be a potential option for treating high-risk COVID-19 patients and preventing
                pulmonary disease in people at increased risk of infection from the virus, including healthcare
                workers.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Is this part of the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project?</h1>
            <p>No. Though you might have heard about that or similar efforts in recent weeks, or
                even know someone who is participating in them, the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is a separate
                initiative led by the world’s leading plasma experts. A key difference is that we are not giving
                plasma itself to COVID-19 patients, but instead using the plasma we collect to help develop a
                potential therapy.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Do I need to tell my doctor or insurance company that I’m donating?</h1>
            <p>Your doctor will need to provide written documentation that you have recovered from
                COVID-19 and are no longer contagious. You shouldn’t need to inform your insurance provider, as
                you will not be charged in any way for your donation.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Do I need to change my diet?</h1>
            <p>In general, no. However, you should be well-nourished. Please eat a light but
                healthy meal three hours before your donation. This means a meal that is high in protein (such
                as eggs, fish, or nuts), rich in iron (such as tuna, lean red meat, nuts, or beans), and low in
                fat (fatty or fried foods can interfere with laboratory testing). Since plasma is 90% water, you
                should also be well-hydrated, so drink plenty of water, juice, or other fluids the day before
                your donation. Please do not drink any alcohol the night before or the day of your donation.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <h1>Can I donate more than twice?</h1>
            <p>You certainly may donate more than twice — so long as you’re eligible at each
                donation. We encourage you to consider becoming a regular plasma donor to help save lives!
                Plasma is used in a variety of therapies, including to help treat serious and rare diseases.</p>

            <h1>How else can I help fight COVID-19?</h1>
            <p>If you know someone else who has recovered from COVID-19, please encourage them to
                visit this website to learn more about the opportunity to donate their plasma as well!</p>

            <h1>Your Plasma Is Needed Now</h1>
            <p>If you have recovered from COVID-19 recently, your plasma may have the power to help others
                through a potential treatment for the new coronavirus.</p>
            <p>By donating your plasma, a part of your blood that contains proteins and antibodies, you could
                play a key role in helping scientists develop an investigational plasma-derived therapy for treating
                high-risk COVID-19 patients that will be tested in clinical trials this summer. The results of these trials
                will determine whether the new therapy has the potential to treat high-risk COVID-19 patients and prevent
                pulmonary disease in people at increased risk of infection from the virus, including healthcare workers.</p>
            <p>The fight against COVID-19 starts with you. You’re a survivor. Now be a hero. Learn more here
                about how you can be a part of this historic effort to treat the new coronavirus and stop the spread of the
                pandemic.</p>
