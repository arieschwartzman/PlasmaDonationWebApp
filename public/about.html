        <p class="title">Donating plasma is a low-risk procedure with minimal or no side effects.</p>
        <p class="key-steps">Here are the key steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Registration</span>
                <p>Prospective donors show identification, enter their contact info, and take a photo and fingerprint
                    scan so they can be entered into the donation center’s electronic system. A medical historian also
                    checks the prospective donor’s name in a national registry to make sure they are eligible to donate.
                    All identification and medical information is confidential.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Screening</span>
                <p>All donors must pass a pre-donation screening at every appointment. First-time donors are interviewed
                    about their medical history. Typical questions include medications, allergies, medical conditions,
                    and surgeries. First-time donors will also undergo a routine health exam. The goal of this screening
                    is to make sure that the donation is safe for both the donor and the recipient of the final
                    product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Donation Area</span>
                <p>Once donation eligibility has been confirmed, donors are led to the donation area. Here, they rest on
                    recliners while connected to an automated machine, and are carefully monitored by staff throughout
                    the donation process. Donors are welcome to relax, read, or use free Wi-Fi to watch their favorite
                    shows.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Plasma Donation</span>
                <p>The safe and sterile process for donating plasma is called plasmapheresis (“plaz-muh-fuh-REE-sis”).
                    It is similar to donating blood, except that plasma is separated and collected while red and white
                    blood cells are returned to the body.</p>

                            <p class="text">Plasma is the pale yellow liquid portion of your blood, and it can be easily
                                replaced by your body. It consists mainly of water and proteins, which help your body
                                control bleeding and infection.</p>

                            <p class="title">How is Plasma Used?</p>
                            <p class="text">Plasma is processed into a wide variety of life-saving treatments that help
                                thousands of people every day. These plasma-derived therapies are used to treat serious
                                and rare diseases, including primary immunodeficiency and hemophilia. It is important to
                                remember that human plasma cannot be made in a lab or by artificial methods. It only
                                comes from healthy adults. Plasma donors help save lives and treat serious and rare
                                diseases.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This process is automatically repeated until a target amount of plasma has been collected, which
                    typically takes less than an hour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Compensation</span>
                <p>Donors receive compensation for their time in the form of a debit card. Donors who qualify for the
                    COVID-19 program will receive $200 for each visit, up to a total of $400 for two donations completed
                    within 14 days.</p>

        <p class="text">If you have recovered from COVID-19 recently, your plasma may have the power to help others
            through a potential treatment for the new coronavirus.</p>
        <p class="text">By donating your plasma, a part of your blood that contains proteins and antibodies, you could
            play a key role in helping scientists develop an investigational plasma-derived therapy for treating
            high-risk COVID-19 patients that will be tested in clinical trials this summer. The results of these trials
            will determine whether the new therapy has the potential to treat high-risk COVID-19 patients and prevent
            pulmonary disease in people at increased risk of infection from the virus, including healthcare workers.</p>
