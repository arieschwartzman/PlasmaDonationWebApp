      "By donating your plasma, a part of your blood that contains proteins and antibodies, you could play a key role in helping scientists develop an investigational plasma-derived therapy for treating high-risk COVID-19 patients that will be tested in clinical trials this summer. The results of these trials will determine whether the new therapy has the potential to treat high-risk COVID-19 patients and prevent pulmonary disease in people at increased risk of infection from the virus, including healthcare workers.",

        "Scientists from around the world have come together to create a new Alliance aimed at stopping the spread of coronavirus. They are looking to collect plasma at licensed plasma donation centers across the US from healthy individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Known as convalescent plasma, the plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients contains critical antibodies that can be used to make an experimental treatment.",
        "The sooner scientists receive so-called convalescent plasma donations, the sooner the Alliance may be able to start manufacturing an investigational plasma-derived therapy and begin clinical trials. These trials will determine if the investigational therapy could help high-risk COVID-19 patients recover and whether it could protect high-risk individuals from the disease.",
        "If your doctor has confirmed that you have fully recovered from COVID-19 and are no longer contagious, we encourage you to contact your nearest plasma donation center. You might be eligible to donate plasma and help others recover from COVID-19.",
        "Providing your information does not obligate you to donate, and it does not guarantee that you will be able to participate in the donor program. All candidates must provide valid identification and are required to undergo a medical screening to ensure eligibility. Medical staff will be available to explain the donation process and answer any questions you may have before you agree to donate. The Alliance takes your privacy very seriously, and your information will be managed in accordance with all local, state, and federal regulations.",
        "The new coronavirus is still spreading, and COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide. We need survivors like you to help us develop potential treatments for those still at risk.",

            "You shouldn’t. Unlike donating blood, which sometimes does make people feel that way because they lose red blood cells, the plasma donation process returns both red and white blood cells back to your body. Drinking plenty of water the day before and the day of your donation will help you feel fine after your donation. That said, if you have a history of feeling faint at the sight of blood, please let us know."

As much as we appreciate your first donation, it can only be used once you donate a second time. That’s because your second donation allows us to repeat testing for specific infectious diseases. This ensures that the plasma is safe to use."

          "a": [
            "No. Plasma collected from individual donors is pooled, processed, and concentrated into a liquid that contains antibodies (part of the immune system). This plasma-derived therapy must then be tested in clinical trials to determine if it is safe and effective before it could be approved as a treatment."

            "Plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 – known as “convalescent plasma” – contains antibodies that can help fight the virus. This plasma can be used in two ways. One way is transfusing it directly to people who have active COVID-19. The other is using the plasma to make a potential treatment called a polyclonal hyperimmune globulin (H-IG), which concentrates the antibodies into a medicine.",
            "Both uses are important, and both have the potential to treat COVID-19. We welcome all initiatives to address the pandemic, including vaccines and other treatments. The work of The CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is focusing on developing an H-IG, which has properties that make it a very promising candidate for a potential global treatment for COVID-19."

        {
          "q": "What are the benefits of H-IG?",
          "a": [
            "Because H-IG has a higher concentration of antibodies, it can be delivered in lower volumes, and therefore would likely take less time to administer to patients than plasma itself. H-IG also has a longer shelf life, which makes it easier to ship to patients around the world. Both of these attributes also make H-IG much easier for hospitals to store and administer to patients.",
            "The manufacturing process used to produce plasma-based therapies makes it possible to set standards for antibody levels. This process, which includes numerous steps of virus inactivation and removal, significantly reduces the risk of transmitting any kind of virus (not just coronavirus) from donors to patients.",
            "Plasma-derived therapies, like H-IG, have already been shown to be effective in treating severe viral respiratory infections. The work of the Alliance is determining whether they may also be a potential option for treating high-risk COVID-19 patients and preventing pulmonary disease in people at increased risk of infection from the virus, including healthcare workers."

A key difference is that we are not giving plasma itself to COVID-19 patients, but instead using the plasma we collect to help develop a potential therapy."

This means a meal that is high in protein (such as eggs, fish, or nuts), rich in iron (such as tuna, lean red meat, nuts, or beans), and low in fat (fatty or fried foods can interfere with laboratory testing). Since plasma is 90% water, you should also be well-hydrated, so drink plenty of water, juice, or other fluids the day before your donation. Please do not drink any alcohol the night before or the day of your donation."
